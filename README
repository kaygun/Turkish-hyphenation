This is a very small library which consists of only two functions 

  int iswovel(unsigned char c);
  char *hyphen(unsigned char *arg);

'iswovel' returns 1 if the character 'c' is a wovel in the Turkish 
alphabet, and returns 0 if it is a consonant.

'hyphen' returns the word 'arg' in hypenated form. The hyphen character 
is '-'.
